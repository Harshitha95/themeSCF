STEP 1	

	- go to first-network inside this directory
	
	- run
			./byfn -m  down


STEP 2

	- in the same directory run
		
			./byfn -m generate -c myc


STEP 3

	- after that run

		docker-compose -f docker-compose-cli.yaml up -d
		
		docker exec -it cli bash


STEP 4

	- now you're inside the cli container
	- type 'ls' and you'll see a directory called scripts
	- in that 'scripts/' there are two bash scripts :

		
		chan.sh	:	this is used to create channel, join peers to channel and specify anchor peer etc...

		installCC.sh :	this'll install AND instantiate all chaincodes need for "Disbursement Transaction" ONLY

		invokeCC.sh : this'll invoke all necessary ledgers

	- run these two :

		cd scripts/
		./chain.sh
		./installCC.sh


	- come back to peer/	(scripts# cd ../)

		invoke all the needed chaincodes :	the invoke cmds can be found at EncoreBlockchain/commandLists/dummyArgs.txt

			ie.
					bankcc
					businesscc
					walletcc (4times)


	- FINALLY invoke the transaction ( here is the problem, debug and find the error)
